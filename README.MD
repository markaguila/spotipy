# 🎧 Spotipy2 — Spotify Stats Analyzer

Spotipy2 is a web-based prototype for analyzing a user’s Spotify library.  
It visualizes which albums and artists a user has liked the most — by **total liked songs** and by **percentage of songs liked** per album or artist.

This build uses a **local CSV dataset** as a mock Spotify library and simulates user libraries for testing.  
The system is designed to scale up to the **Spotify Web API** in production.
